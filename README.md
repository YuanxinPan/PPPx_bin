## Installation

### Linux

This application is distributed as an [AppImage](https://appimage.org/), making it portable
across most modern Linux distributions. Specifically, `pppx` is built on Ubuntu 20.04 and it
requires the host system to have **GNU C Library (`glibc`) version 2.31 or newer**.

It is compatible with the following distributions (and any of their derivatives):

| Distribution Family | Supported Versions
| :--- | :--- |
| **Ubuntu** | 20.04 LTS, 22.04 LTS, 24.04 LTS (and newer) |
| **Linux Mint** | 20, 21, 22 (and newer) |
| **Debian** | 11 "Bullseye", 12 "Bookworm" (and newer) |
| **Fedora** | 32 (and newer) |
| **RHEL / Rocky / Alma** | 9.x (and newer) *Note: RHEL 8 is not supported* |
| **openSUSE** | Leap 15.3+, Tumbleweed |
| **Arch Linux / Manjaro** | Rolling releases (Always updated) |

❓ **Not sure if your system is supported?**

> You can easily check your system's `glibc` version by running the `ldd --version` command in your terminal


#### Option 1: Automated Installation (Recommended)

Run this single command to automatically download and install the latest release to `~/.local/bin`:

```shell
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YuanxinPan/PPPx_bin/main/install.sh | bash
```


#### Option 2: Manual Installation

If you prefer not to use the automated script, you can install `pppx` manually:
1. Download the `pppx_v1.x.x_linux_x86_64.zip` asset from the latest
   [Release](https://github.com/YuanxinPan/PPPx_bin/releases)
2. Extract the archive to obtain the `pppx` executable
3. Open your terminal and navigate to your download folder
4. Make the file executable and move it to your user binary folder:

```shell
chmod +x pppx
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
mv pppx ~/.local/bin/pppx

# Restart your terminal and run `pppx` to test if it works
# If not, add `~/.local/bin` to PATH via the command below:
echo "export PATH=\${HOME}/.local/bin:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
```


### Windows

The easiest way to run `pppx` on Windows is via the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
However, `pppx` can also run natively on Windows using PowerShell or Command Prompt (cmd.exe).


#### Option 1: Automated Installation (Recommended)

Open PowerShell and run this command. It will automatically download the executable, fetch the required DLLs, and add the software (`C:\Users\<YOUR_USER_NAME>\AppData\Local\Programs\PPPx`) to your system `PATH`:

```PowerShell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YuanxinPan/PPPx_bin/main/install.ps1 | iex
```
> Note: You must restart PowerShell or cmd.exe after the installation


#### Option 2: Manual Installation

If you prefer not to use the automated script, you can install `pppx` manually:
1. Download the `pppx_v1.x.x_windows_x86_64.zip` asset from the latest [Release](https://github.com/YuanxinPan/PPPx_bin/releases)
2. Download the required Windows DLLs via this [link](https://github.com/YuanxinPan/PPPx_bin/releases/download/v1.2.1/pppx_winows_dlls.zip)
3. Create the PPPx folder: `C:\Users\<YOUR_USER_NAME>\AppData\Local\Programs\PPPx`
3. Extract both archives and place the `.dll` files and `pppx.exe` in the PPPx folder
4. Add the absolute path of this folder to your Windows `PATH` environment variable
5. Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and type `pppx.exe` to test if it is correctly installed


### macOS

`pppx` only supports Macs with Apple silicon and an OS version higher than Monterey.

⚠️ **Prerequisite**

If you do not have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on your Mac, please install it first:

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

`pppx` is linked against the latest `ceres-solver` library. Make sure you have
installed the latest version as well in order to run `pppx` properly on your Mac.
Run the following command in the Terminal application:

```shell
brew install ceres-solver
```


#### Option 1: Automated Installation (Recommended)
Run this command in your Terminal to automatically download the latest release, bypass Apple's quarantine security check, and install it to `~/.local/bin/`:

```shell
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YuanxinPan/PPPx_bin/main/install.sh | bash
```


#### Option 2: Manual Installation

If you prefer not to use the automated script, you can install `pppx` manually:
1. Download the `pppx_v1.x.x_macos_arm64.zip` asset from the latest [Release](https://github.com/YuanxinPan/PPPx_bin/releases)
2. Extract the archive to obtain the `pppx` executable
3. Open the Terminal application and navigate to your download folder
4. Move the `pppx` executable to `~/.local/bin/` using Terminal:
```shell
chmod +x pppx
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
mv pppx ~/.local/bin/

echo "export PATH=\${HOME}/.local/bin:\$PATH" >> ~/.zshrc
```
5. Due to Apple's Gatekeeper security settings, you must authorize the software before it will run. You can do this by running `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/.local/bin/pppx` or by following this
[Apple Support Guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unknown-developer-mh40616/mac)
6. Restart your Terminal and run `pppx` to test if it is correctly installed


## Usage

The general steps to process GNSS data with `pppx` are:
1. Prepare RINEX observation files and necessary products (either broadcast ephemeris or precise products)
2. Modify an existing configuration file `pppx.ini`, or create a template ini file:

```shell
pppx -x ppp > pppx.ini  # ppp can be replaced with spp/rtk/tdp
```

3. Execute `pppx` with appropriate command-line arguments:

```shell
pppx -c pppx.ini path-to-rnxo [rnxo-of-base]

# Example usage:

# For SPP/PPP/TDP  (Note: TDP is suitable for high-frequency data, e.g., 1 Hz)
pppx -c pppx.ini rinex/ZIM200CHE_R_20221000000_01D_30S_MO.rnx

# For RTK (ZIMM is the base station in this example)
pppx -c pppx.ini rinex/ZIM200CHE_R_20221000000_01D_30S_MO.rnx rinex/ZIMM00CHE_R_20221000000_01D_30S_MO.rnx
```

To make GNSS data processing easier, the script `scripts/pppx.sh` is provided to
automatically download necessary products (e.g., SP3, CLK, OBX, BIA, ERP, BRDC, GIM, VMF1)
according to the configuration and invoke `pppx` afterwards. Currently, it only
supports the operational products from [CODE](http://ftp.aiub.unibe.ch/CODE/).
The recommended steps to use this wrapper script:

```shell
# Generate a default config file
pppx -x ppp > pppx.ini   # options: spp/ppp/rtk/tdp

# Edit pppx.ini if necessary but keep [product] (except "src") and [table] blank
pppx.sh -c pppx.ini rinex/ZIM200CHE_R_20221000000_01D_30S_MO.rnx
```

> **NOTE**: `scripts/pppx.sh` should be manually edited and the variable
"TABLE\_DIR" (line #42) should be set to the actual "table" folder of the
pppx software package before first use.


### Input

1. Configuration file: [pppx.ini](pppx.ini)
2. GNSS observations: RINEX files
3. Satellite products: Broadcast ephemeris or precise products, specified in `pppx.ini`
4. Table files: Provided in the [table](table/) directory, specified in `pppx.ini`


### Output

1. `pos file`: Receiver position, clock, and ZTD estimates for each epoch
2. `log file`: Debugging information
3. `stat file`: Postfit residuals and various estimates in the RTKLIB stat format, for visualization with [RTKLIB](https://github.com/tomojitakasu/RTKLIB_bin/tree/rtklib_2.4.3)


### Visualization

#### With Python

```shell
# To plot position estimates only
python scripts/plot_ppppos.py pos_file

# To plot position, receiver clock and ZTD estimates
python scripts/plot_ppppos.py pos_file -a

# -a  Plot receiver position, clock, and ZTD estimates
# -i  Interactive mode
# -s  Fixed scale for the y-axis; otherwise, scale is set automatically
```

#### With RTKLIB

For enhanced interactive viewing and visualization of postfit residuals:

1. Open the `rtkplot.exe` application
2. Navigate to "File" > "Open Solution-1" and select the generated stat file
3. Interactively view various plots


## Example

To help you get started, several examples are available in the
[example/pppx](example/pppx) folder. Additionally, an example demonstrating
`pppx` processing of GNSS data collected by Android smartphones is provided in
the [example/smartphone](example/smartphone) folder. Please execute the
correspoding `run.sh` script to see how `pppx` works:

```shell
cd example/pppx/
./run.sh   # processing & plotting
```

For instance, the following is a visualization of a kinematic PPP solution for
the ZIM2 station, using FGO and GPS+Galileo observations:
